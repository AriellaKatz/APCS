DISCO
* All of the methods in Deque are also in the LinkedList interface.

QCC:
* Why would you use getFirst/Last() or removeFirst/Last() when peekFirst/Last() and pollFirst/Last(), respectfully, do the same things without the possibility of throwing an error?
* You can always check to see if the method returns null, but if an error is thrown, it will halt the process of running the code.
