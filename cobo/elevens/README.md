### Our Experience
We skipped Activity 6 because the necessary files were't present in the library. We also skipped Activities 5, 10 and 11 because they were optional and this assignment took more than half an hour. Our group worked well together :) The instructions were useful and building the program step by step ensured we knew what was going on. However, some exploration activities were not useful because we already learned those topics. In the end, it was nice to have a finished product and a playable game.
