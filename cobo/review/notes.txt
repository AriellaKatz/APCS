ANSWERS:
Activity 1:
  1a. public static double sentimentVal( String word )
  1b. It requires a String parameter. Passing any other parameter throws an error.
  1c. The method returns a double.
  2. sentimentVal("administration"); -> -0.02
     sentimentVal("americans"); -> -0.94
     sentimentVal("computer"); -> 0.15
  3a. It is compilable. A String is passed through sentimentVal() and num
      matches the returntype (double).
  3b. It is not compilable. A double is passed through sentimentVal() instead of
      a String and the returntype is a double, not a String.
  3c. It is not compilable. sentimentVal() only accepts one argument.
Activity 2:
  4. We convert the text in the file into one long String, and then use the
     String.split() method to split that string into an array of words,
     separated by spaces. We then use a specialized for loop to iterate through
     that array, and for each word, getting rid of any punctuation and adding
     its sentiment value to the running total sentiment value. After the entire
     array has been traversed, the total sentiment value is returned.
  5a. The rating does not make sense. For example, our SimpleReview rating was
      very positive, but it only earned 3 stars. Although the overall review had
      an overwhelmingly positive sentiment, the individual words tended towards
      more negative sentiments, resulting in a deceptively low sentiment value.
  5b. We could look for places where the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 are used, and
      if they're followed by "stars", use that for the rating.
      We could use the word "not" to negate the sentiment value of the word
      following it.
  6.  All reviews with ratings below 15 will earn ratings of 4, and all reviews
      with ratings above or equal to 15 will earn ratings of 0. This is because
      any totalSentiment less than 0 will also be less than 5, any less than 5
      will also be less than 10, and any less than 10 will also be less than 15,
      so all of these will work for the first if statement. They might fix their
      code by reversing the order of the if statements (< 0, then < 5, then
      < 10, etc.).

NOTES:
* What is the static {...} section at the beginning of the class?
* How might we be able to use context clues to improve totalSentiment?
  For example, using the word "not" might automatically negate the sentiment
  of the following word.
