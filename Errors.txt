This file contains errors I get when running my code and my notes on them.

error: class found on application class path: GreetNew
Occurs when you issue the command 
	$ java class.java
Be sure that when you're running the program (aka when you use the command 
 java instead of javac), you only provide the class name (sans .java).

error: non-static variable helloMsg cannot be referenced from a static context
Occurs when an instance variable is referenced inside a method listed as 
 static. The purpose of an instance variable is that its value is unique for
 each instance of its class, and having it in a static method prevents its
 value from changing.
