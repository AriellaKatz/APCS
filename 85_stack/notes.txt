DISCO:
0. PANCAKES can only be used in the implementation of a class, not in the
initiation of one. When you have Class<Z> tester = new Class<Z>(), Z must be an
actual class, not a generalization.
1. The compiler will only recognize what PANCAKES is if it's included in the
heading of the class.
QCC:
0. Once we wrote ALStack, we literally copied and pasted it into LLStack and
replaced any occurrences of "ALStack" in the code with "LLStack", and it worked
perfectly. Since there's no difference in coding ALStack or LLStack, what makes
one better than the other? Should we consider the behind-the-scenes work of the
ArrayList and LinkedList classes?
