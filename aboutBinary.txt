0. "Base" refers to the number of unique digits available to represent numbers. For example, in binary, or "base-2", there are 2 available digits: 0 and 1.
1. Binary is a base-2 number system (using digits 0 and 1) that is used to represent numbers through sums of powers of 2 (see 2.). Binary is mportant because 
    it's the most basic "language of computers. It's the simplest number system used in computer programming while achieving the same amount of work as any 
    other number system. Its 0's and 1's can represent basic outcomes, like on vs. off, true vs. false, yes vs. no. 
2. Binary -> Decimal Algorithm:
    Given a binary number...
      0. For the nth digit from the right, multiply that digit by 2^(n-1).
      1. Repeat step 0 for all digits.
      2. Find the sum of the results for each digit.
      This sum is the equivalent decimal number.
    Ex: 
3. Decmial -> Binary Algorithm:
    Given a decimal number...
      0. Divide by 2 and record the remainder (0 or 1).
      1. Repeat step 0 for the integer quotient of step 0.
      2. Repeat step 1 until the quotient is 0.
      3. List the remainders in order of how they were computed from right to left.

Ex 35-->100011

35/2 = 17 r 1
17/2 = 8 r 1
8/2 = 4 r 0
4/2 = 2 r 0
2/2= 1 r 0
1/2 = 0 r 1

--> 100011
