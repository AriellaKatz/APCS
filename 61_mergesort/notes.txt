HW61 - Instructions so Simple...
2022-02-08
time spent: 0.5 hrs

DISCO:
0. This algo utilizes recursion! The base case is a deck
   height of 1.

QCC:
0. Could we optimize this by checking whether the deck
   has 2 cards, and if so, just merging them instead of
   dividing by 2 again?

THINKER FIRMWARE:
0. Is it sorted? (Is the deck height 1?)
1. If yes: You're done!
2. If no:
  a. Divide the deck into two.
  b. Have 2 available thinkeren sort each half.
  c. Merge the 2 now-sorted halves.
