	• Error type:
		- Compile-time: syntax error
		- Run-time: An issue occurs while it's running (like an infinite loop)
			* Syntax is technically correct; it gets past the compiler.
		- Logic: Program does not perform as desired.
			* Won't actually throw an error
	• Compile-time errors:
		- If you have a lot of errors, chances are most of them are byproducts
		  of the 1st one.
		- When looking for the problem code, look prior to wherever Java noticed
		  the error. 
			* You may have to follow the flow of execution to the definition of
			  another method.
		- Debugging by bisection:
			* If you can't find the cause of an error
			1. Make a new file.
			2. Copy the 1st half of your code into it.
			3. If the file compiles, add half of the remaining half.
			4. Keep going until you narrow down where the error is.
	• Run-time errors:
		- A program "hangs" if it appears to stop and do nothing.
			* If you suspect a loop, print a message right before and right
			  after the loop so you can see if Java gets stuck between the two
			  (and only prints the 1st method).
			* StackOverflowErrors come from infinite recursive loops.
		- If you think you have an infinite loop: Print the values of the variables
		  in the conditional after each iteration to see if they're getting updated
		  properly and the conditional works.
		- If you think you have an infinite recursion: Make sure you have a base
		  case. If you do, print the parameter values at the beginning of each
		  recursive call to see if the parameters are approaching the base case.
		- Exceptions:
			* NullPointerException: You tried to access an attribute or object
			  with a value of null.
			* ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: The index you're trying to access
			  is <0 or >(array.length-1).
			* FileNotFoundException: Java didn't find the file it's looking for.
			* Arithmetic Exception: A problem with an arithmetic operation, like
			  /0.
			* StackOverflowError
	• Logic errors:
		- Common logic errors:
			* int division
			* Don't rely on floating-point numbers to be perfectly accurate.
			* == vs .equals() for objects
			* print (rather than println) statements may be stored until the next
			  newline.
