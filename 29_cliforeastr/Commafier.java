DISCO:
0. In commafyR, when it invokes itself, it follows flow of execution. 
	Ex: commafyR(100 000 000) *Spaces added for visual clarity (pretend they aren't
		there)
	commafyR(100 000 000)
	commafyR(100 000) + "," + "000"
	commafy(100) + "," + "000" + "," + "000"
	100 + "," + "000" + "," + "000"
	100,000,000
	NOT...
	commafyR(100 000 000)
	commafyR(commafyR(100) + "," + "000") + "," + "000"
	Basically, just be careful how you keep track of what has been returned/invoked
	and what has yet to be invoked.
1. In the command line, typing...
	java Class input1 input2 input3 ...etc
   will invoke the main() method with a String array containing these inputs.
QCC:
None
