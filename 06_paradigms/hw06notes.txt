HW06 -- Comparing syntax of different languages: "Hello, world!"
2021-09-28
Worked with: Jacob Kirmayer, Nafiz Labib, Kaitlin Ho

Similarities: 
In all programs, Hello, world! is surrounded by quotation marks.
Both NetLogo and Python use the command "print".
Scheme and Python both utilize parentheses. 

Differences:
Scheme uses the command "display" instead of "print".
Scheme surrounds the entire procedure in parentheses. Python surrounds only the argument in parentheses. NetLogo does not require parentheses.

Notes:
Scheme seems to be the same as Dr.Racket for this purpose.
